# Analysis of Monte Carlo Benchmark Results

This document provides instructions for analyzing and plotting the benchmark results generated by `src/benchmark.jl`.

## 1. Objective

The goal is to visualize the performance scaling of the multi-threaded and multi-process implementations relative to the serial baseline. We are primarily interested in **speedup**, defined as:

$$ \text{Speedup} = \frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{T_{\text{parallel}}} $$

where $T$ is the wall-clock execution time.

## 2. Loading the Data

First, ensure you have run the benchmark script and have a `benchmark_summary.csv` file in your `results/` directory.

You can load and inspect the data in a Julia REPL or script:

```julia
using DataFrames, CSV, Plots

# Load the benchmark results
df = CSV.read("results/benchmark_summary.csv", DataFrame)

# Filter for Julia implementations to plot scaling
df_threads = filter(row -> row.implementation == "julia_threads", df)
df_dist = filter(row -> row.implementation == "julia_distributed", df)

println(df)
